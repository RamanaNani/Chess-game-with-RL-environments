<center><h1>Improving Chess Strategies with Deep RL Methods</h1></center>

It is a dual agent game

## Problem Statement
The main aim of the project is to create a smart system that learns to play chess on its own using reinforcement learning methods

## Environment
PettingZoo is a multi-agent reinforcement learning platform that offers various environments for conducting complex interaction studies between agents. One such environment is the chess game provided within PettingZooâ€™s classic collection. This setup allows for the exploration of complex agent interactions within a structured and strategic game setting, making it an ideal testbed for developing and testing advanced reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms.
* Action space: The environment provides a discrete action space with 4672 possible actions
* Observation Space: The observation shape is defined as (8, 8, 111), which likely represents a structured format for the chess board where each piece and possible move is encoded within this multidimensional array.
* Agents: There are 2 agents Player_0, Player_1
* Rewards: +1 if agent wins, -1 if the agent looses and 0 if the game is draw
